# Neovim Config

This is my neovim basic config for web applications with go in the backend. Furthermore, it also supports lua.

## Known problems

1. Golangci-lint was updated to version 2 (breaking change) and nvim-lint needs some fixing. Using the linter in the terminal of neovim works.
2. Golines,gci and gofumpt are all used for formatting go code, hence formatting a go file can take some time.

## Supported languages

1. Go
2. Lua
3. Typescript
4. Angular
5. Docker
